After running a joomla forum in Kunena for many years, it was time to leave joomla behind and start using Wordpress.
But converting the Kunena 5 to bbPress did not work at all. So decided to write a python script to move all the valuable content.

WARNING: this script is free to use and assumes a certain level of programming knowledge. Use at own risk, always backup your data, NO WARRENTY and the use of a staging environment to test is advised


How to use
- run localy in python environment
- load (virtual environment
- configure by setting correct values in config.ini (RENAME)

Make sure u use DRY_RUN=True first.

Run import.py
